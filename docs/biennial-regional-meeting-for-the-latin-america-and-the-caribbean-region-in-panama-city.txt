Biennial Regional Meeting for the Latin America and the Caribbean region in
Panama City

For an international agency responsible for humanitarian and developmental aid,
we organized a three-day biennial meeting in Panama for the Latin America and
Caribbean (LAC) region. The event brought together approximately 100
participants from 20 countries, aiming to enhance collaboration among
fundraising teams across various countries in the region. The primary goal of
the meeting was to foster a shared vision, facilitate knowledge exchange, and
develop actionable plans for country-specific fundraising efforts while aligning
with regional objectives.

Biennial Regional Meeting for the Latin America and the Caribbean region in
Panama City

Need to unite diverse country teams in the LAC region to align fundraising
goals, share best practices, and develop actionable country-specific plans.

A structured, human-centered workshop combining visioning, collaborative
knowledge-sharing sessions, and focused planning activities to align teams
across LAC countries with a shared regional goal.

3-day event: 100 participants, 20 countries, a shared vision statement, cross-
country knowledge exchange initiatives, and concrete action plans for each
country to drive regional fundraising success.

Designed and conducted entirely in Spanish, this meeting served as a catalyst
for fostering collaboration, exchanging knowledge, and driving meaningful impact
in the region. The actionable plans and shared vision empower the agency to
maximize private sector revenue and achieve its mission across the LAC region.

We designed the 3-days agenda, the methodology and all the co-design activities:

iterative problem-solving to ensure outcomes were ambitious yet
practical.Balanced Structure: Sessions alternated between regional convergence
and country-specific divergence to address both shared and localized
challenges.Key Activities:

best practices and insights.

Country-Specific Planning: Breakout sessions for each country team to create
actionable plans aligned with the regional vision.

plans and fostered ongoing collaboration.
