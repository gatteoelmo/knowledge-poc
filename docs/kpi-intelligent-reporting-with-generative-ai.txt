KPI Intelligent Reporting with Generative AI

An innovative system capable of automatically calculating numerical indicators
linked to ESG ratings from sustainability reports that contain heterogeneous
data (by source, format, and complexity). The pipeline addresses the challenge
of information fragmentation by searching data from text and tables and flagging
information gaps. Using a structured approach and advanced NLP modules, the tool
ensures accuracy and reliability, even in long and complex documents.

KPI Intelligent Reporting with Generative AI

Extract specific information from sustainability reports and automatically
calculate certain KPIs related to ESG ratings.

A pipeline that integrates the capabilities of a traditional search engine with
those of an LLM to achieve automatic calculation of ESG KPIs.

A faster and more accurate process of analyzing ESG reports, with timely and
verifiable information.

The goal of this project is to extract precise information from sustainability
reports and automatically calculate some KPIs related to ESG rating.Our system
automates the process of calculating KPIs, solving the challenge of extracting
relevant data from long and inhomogeneous documents.The pipeline consists of
four main modules:

Search: automatically locates the most relevant sections of documents with
respect to the KPI to be calculated.

Entity Extraction: extracts specific data using a GPT-based information
extraction module.

KPI calculation: calculates KPIs from the extracted information.

Filtering: checks the results and reports any errors.

The system operates accurately: correctly extracted information reaches 84% in
the simplest cases.When a reliable answer cannot be provided, the tool flags it,
reducing the risk of misleading results. This solution enables sustainability
reports to be transformed into usable data for ESG assessments, improving
transparency and efficiency.
