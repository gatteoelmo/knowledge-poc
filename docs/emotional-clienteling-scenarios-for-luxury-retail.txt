Emotional clienteling scenarios for luxury retail

The client, a luxury brand, needed to innovate its clienteling strategies, going
beyond the transactional model to build a more authentic and personalized
connection with its customers. The project led to the definition of a series of
clienteling scenarios, aimed at transforming brand-customer interactions into
meaningful experiences that reflect the brand’s DNA, guided by qualitative and
quantitative insights. Each scenario was structured through a concept kit,
including trend analysis, paradigm shift identification, qualitative and
quantitative insights, branded mockups, and a scalable action plan.

Emotional clienteling scenarios for luxury retail

Redefining clienteling strategies to create a stronger emotional bond between
brand and customer, moving beyond the traditional model based on transactional
interactions.

Development of a series of clienteling scenarios, each built through trend
analysis, qualitative and quantitative insights, branded mockups, and a scalable
action plan.

This approach enables the design of more engaging and personalized experiences,
leading to a positive impact on customer loyalty and conversion rates.

Clienteling is often based on repetitive and transactional interactions, such as
birthday greetings or product pushes. However, as customer expectations evolve,
there is a growing need for a more sophisticated approach capable of fostering a
deeper emotional connection with the brand. The project focused on creating
clienteling scenarios to redefine engagement strategies and make customer
relationships more authentic. To develop these scenarios, an in-depth research
process was conducted, including trend analysis and both qualitative and
quantitative data analysis. This research allowed for the identification of the
limitations of current strategies and the definition of new interaction models,
more focused on emotions and customer experiences.

Each scenario was developed through a structured package composed of:

Trend Analysis: An assessment of key trends in customer behavior.

Paradigm Shift: A strategic reflection on the transition from a traditional
model to a more personalized approach.

Qualitative & Quantitative Insights: A data-driven analysis to ensure that each
scenario responds to concrete customer needs.

Branded Mockup: A visual representation of the scenario, integrated into the
brand’s identity to facilitate understanding and application.

Scalable Action Plan: An implementation roadmap including quick-win solutions as
well as more complex, long-term strategies.
