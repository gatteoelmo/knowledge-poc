Ideact, Ferrero's innovation program

Ideact is Ferrero Italia's initiative launched with the goal of working with
young talents on the development of innovative ideas.

The need for this kind of program was born out of the leadership team, which
wanted to collect fresh ideas to work on in a short amount of time, and
to involve younger people from the workforce in significant change processes.

Ideact, Ferrero's innovation program

A project to develop tangible and solid, but innovative ideas that could at the
same time involve under-30 people in the company.

An agile, flexible and engaging program, to allow Ferrero Italia's under-30
people to develop tangible and innovative ideas.

71 under-30 participants (100% in-target), 3 launched briefs, a top manager
jury, 8 finalist ideas, 1 winning solution.

Ideact is the agile, flexible and engaging program developed by MAIZE for
Ferrero, after having collectively defined the project’s objectives with the
core team.

In a few steps and with the constant support of MAIZE mentors, the program's
participants managed to develop innovative and tangible ideas with colleagues
from different divisions.

The program's objective was to invest on the generation of new ideas to
transform them into projects to integrate in the company's business strategies.

Moreover, the program had an educational objective: allow participants to
acquire new skills and work methodologies, so to provide them all the tools to
become the main actors in Ferrero's future.

At the end of the program we organized an online event where the finalist teams
presented their solution through an elevator pitch. A jury made up of Ferrero's
top managers finally decided on the winning idea.
