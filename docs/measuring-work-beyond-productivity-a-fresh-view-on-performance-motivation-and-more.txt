Measuring Work beyond Productivity: a fresh view on Performance, Motivation and
more.

Measuring Work Beyond Productivity is a research project focused on four key
aspects of corporate culture: motivation, performance, rewards and wellbeing at
work. To provide a clear picture of the current situation and workers’ needs, we
designed the study to answer the following questions: Are the criteria and
methods used to evaluate people still relevant? What value does performance
measurement hold for workers? And what elements should organizations measure
going forward?

Measuring Work beyond Productivity: a fresh view on Performance, Motivation and
more.

Providing a European perspective on current workplace practices and future
needs, particularly in measuring the value created by workers, ensuring growth,
and fostering a balanced environment.

We created an interactive data room on our website to explore findings, a
printed folding summary, three interviews featuring workplace experts, and a
presentation event to open up the conversation.

The sharing of the results sparked discussions among HR and People specialists,
as well as other professionals interested in innovating within their
organizations.

The study explores the evolving relationship between productivity and humanity
in contemporary European workplaces, aiming to understand employees’ experiences
and how they expect work measurement to change. Our methodology combined
insights from both quantitative and qualitative sources: we surveyed over 2,000
employees across Denmark, Germany, Spain, France, and Italy; we referenced
foundational HR research by authors such as Daniel Pink and James Burns.
Additionally, we interviewed workplace experts pioneering new approaches to
measurement and culture, including Biancamaria Cavallini (Scientific Director at
Mindwork), Gianfranco Chimirri (CPO at SACE), and Simone Cesano (Senior Director
at MAIZE), while considering evolving global workplace trends.

Some of the most significant findings revealed that people are seeking a
multidimensional approach to growth – both for themselves and their
organizations. Currently, nearly half of workers find no value in the
performance review process, a phenomenon particularly pronounced in larger
companies. Line managers rank last among factors that contribute to workplace
motivation, and currently less than 10% of respondents are evaluated by their
peers, despite more than half wanting this type of feedback.
