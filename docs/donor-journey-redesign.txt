DONOR JOURNEY REDESIGN

Donor journey redesign

A client in the nonprofit sector focused on research and prevention asked for
our support in transitioning to an omnichannel approach to put the donor-not the
donation channel-at the center of their strategy.We worked on evolving the
current Donor Journeys with the goal of improving the donor experience and
expanding data collection opportunities.

Donor journey redesign

Evolve current Donor Journeys with the goal of improving the donor experience
and expanding data collection opportunities.

Through mapping and analysis of current journeys and a benchmark, we identified
pain points and opportunities for evolution that guided us in redesigning donor
journeys to-be.

2 as-is donor-journey mappings, 2 co-design workshops, 30 opportunities, 6
design drivers, 2 donor journeys to-be

In the initial phase of the project, we analyzed existing materials and
documentation to understand the complexity of the sector and the reality in
which to intervene. To absorb and make our own contextual knowledge in relation
to the donation experience and how channels and touchpoints are managed, we
conducted a series of in-depth meetings with the core team to map as-is
journeys.Through benchmarking, we dedicated ourselves to identifying best
practices and trends and sought cross-industry inspiration that could be useful
to the project.We then identified evolutionary opportunities by drawing high-
level Journey to-be's, highlighting opportunities to evolve the donor
experience, current channels/touchpoints, and the data collection process at
different stages of the experience: from discovery, to donation, to post-
donation science communication and dissemination.
