VoiceMath: product description

A tool to create handouts from videos and pdfs produced during university
lectures.

A web application that shows video transcription and LaTeX transcription of pdfs
with formulas in one screen and allows the transcribed content to be reprocessed
to create a handout.

The developed tool provides the user with all the tools to create a handout:
video and pdf transcription, text editor, quick editing tools, and export to
LaTex.

After an initial development phase, in which we dealt with the implementation of
a Speech-to-Text component for transcribing the teacher's voice into text form
and an image processing module, for converting images of formulas into LaTeX
format (from a video recording and pdf of a lecture) and an initial testing
phase with a few users, the development of the prototype was continued,
expanding its functionality.Now VoiceMath is a product available to some 20
users in the University; the University of Turin's authentication system has
been integrated so that users can log in using their own credentials. In
addition, features of the application such as a text editor, quick editing
tools, audio playback, pdf display, and export to LaTex have been expanded.
