Swarovski Digital Roadmap 2030: An Inspirational Workshop

Help the Swarovski team understand changes in the luxury market and the skills
necessary to adapt, by defining a digital roadmap for 2030.

An inspirational workshop that combined strategic analysis and case studies from
brands like Adidas and Lego, providing the team with tools to imagine
Swarovski’s digital future.

The workshop inspired the Swarovski team, providing concrete insights for
defining their digital roadmap and helping them understand how to adapt to
future challenges in the luxury market.

Swarovski, a luxury brand known for its creativity, has decided to embark on a
digital journey with the goal of optimizing sales and positioning itself
strategically in less-covered markets. The cross-functional team tasked with
this project focused on creating a "digital roadmap" for the future. We
responded with a workshop structured into two main moments:

New Perspectives: an external strategic analysis session exploring the changes
in the luxury market and the possible digital areas that must be covered to
address them.

Case Studies: a retrospective on how brands like Adidas and Lego evolved their
approach over time to respond to market changes and new needs. The workshop also
included a team sharing moment on how to draw inspiration from the experiences
of these brands.
