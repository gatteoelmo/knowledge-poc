PRODUCTION OF ACCESSIBLE DOCUMENTS ACCORDING TO WCAG

------------------------------------------------------------

Production of Accessible Documents According to WCAG

The bank created a rewards program for its customers, offering them the chance
to enter a series of prize contests via a bank app. The program and contests
have specific regulations, including rules, prizes, and participation
specifications. Jakala enlisted Maize's support to ensure that the PDFs of these
regulations were compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
2.0 and the PDF/UA (Universal Access or ISO 14289) standard.

Production of Accessible Documents According to WCAG

Jakala requested our support in creating accessible documents for a major
banking client.

Periodically produce and update accessible documents to disseminate app
sweepstakes regulations.

Develop advanced knowledge of WCAG and learn how to use Word to create
accessible documents.

A document is accessible if it allows any user to independently enjoy its
content. To achieve this, it must meet several criteria described in the WCAG,
including color contrast, a logical reading order, alternative text for
hyperlinks, tables, and images; language settings; and summary
management.Throughout the project, Jakala integrated the new monthly regulatory
information into a Word document once a month. Maize made the document
accessible and converted it to PDF so that another vendor could perform
accessibility checks.
