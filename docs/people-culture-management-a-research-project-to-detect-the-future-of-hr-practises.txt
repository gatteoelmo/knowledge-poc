People & Culture Management: a research project to detect the future of HR
practises

People management is one of the most urgent challenges for Italian companies. In
this context, the People & Culture Management project was launched, promoted by
Fondirigenti with Assolombarda and ALDAI-Federmanager, and carried out by MAIZE
Jakala. Through surveys, focus groups, interviews, and trend research, the
project provided a comprehensive picture of current HR practices and mapped six
strategic directions for transforming the HR role, offering companies actionable
tools to attract, retain, and empower talent.

People & Culture Management: a research project to detect the future of HR
practises

Supporting companies in rethinking HR management in an increasingly fluid and
competitive job market.

A quali-quantitative research effort to analyze the current state, identify
blockers, and define the strategic directions for the evolution of HR.

A comprehensive report with insights and actionable strategies to position HR as
a strategic, inclusive business partner.

The People & Culture Management project was designed to help companies tackle
the growing difficulty in attracting and retaining talent. Promoted by
Fondirigenti in collaboration with Assolombarda and ALDAI-Federmanager, and
delivered by MAIZE Jakala, the project was structured around four key research
phases: a quali-quantitative survey answered by 104 companies, trend research,
focus groups with 16 large enterprises, and interviews with 14 SMEs. The goal
was to understand major HR challenges, analyze current strategies, and identify
alternative models. The research identified six workstreams: active listening as
a response to motivational crisis; personalized growth paths; adoption of
flexible work models; managing generational differences; promoting psychological
well-being; and strengthening employer branding. The initiative concluded with
the release of a report combining data, insights, and best practices to help
companies shift HR from an administrative role to a strategic people partner.The
report was shared with companies through an event open to all Assolombarda
members, and a dedicated landing page was created to support the project.
