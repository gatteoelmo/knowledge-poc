Design of the new flagship model and extension to other branches.

The project aimed to bring a bank’s values and Purpose to life through the
redesign of its flagship store. The goal was to create a space that reflected
the bank’s commitment, providing a physical representation of its identity that
would engage and inspire customers. The challenge was to design a flagship that
embodied the bank’s ethos while establishing a personal connection with
customers. The project concluded with the creation of a design brief outlining
the guidelines for reimagining the store’s spaces and customer experience, which
was then adapted for other branches.

Design of the new flagship model and extension to other branches.

Rethinking the future vision for the Milan flagship store of a bank and
extending the reference model to other branches in the network.

A design brief that encompasses the vision, look & feel, and key guidelines for
each step of the customer experience, ensuring consistency and quality in space
design.

The brand's values and purpose were translated into tangible elements within the
space, enabling a customer experience that reflects them and helps the staff
convey them to clients.

The project began with an immersion in the bank's core values and strategic
objectives, aiming to translate these concepts into tangible elements for the
new experience. Every aspect of the flagship had to be a visible extension of
the brand’s identity.

The design process included:

Brand reflection: The bank’s identity was integrated into the store’s layout and
aesthetics, with details selected to reflect the brand’s commitment to quality
and innovation.

Interactive spaces: Digital zones and communal areas were conceived to enrich
the customer experience, encouraging engagement and interaction.

Personalized elements: Spaces were designed for personalized consultations, such
as lounges for informal discussions and private areas for in-depth financial
advice.

The design brief was then handed over to a design studio to ensure the faithful
execution of the project. The second phase focused on extending the model to the
bank’s branches across Italy, involving an analysis and categorization of the
various branches to create a scalable plan that maintained the flagship
experience's integrity.
