Enhancing the User Experience of an energy platform - Agile UX/UI Team

Jarvis is a platform for gas transportation, storage, and regasification that
was created by combining seventeen different applications. Snam requested
support to improve the user experience on the application. We established an
agile UX/UI room with expertise in Service Design, UX Design, UI Design, and
Front-end Development. This room supports the evolution of Jarvis with
improvement proposals, requirements gathering, user testing, rapid prototyping,
and front-end library updates.

Enhancing the User Experience of an energy platform - Agile UX/UI Team

The establishment of an agile team led by a Service Design background figure
serving seven development teams, responsible for the proper user experience on
the Jarvis application by Snam.

We reorganized from the previous room, not sections of the sites, but based on
demand, the team organizes based on their skills and availability, in true maize
style.

We brought into sprint co-design initiatives with Product Owners and UX research
activities. We provided UX and UX writing guidelines that were not present until
now, except for the UI side.

Jarvis is a commercial platform for gas transportation, storage, and
regasification and was born from the union of seventeen different applications.

Snam asked us for help to maintain and evolve the platform towards the best user
experience on the application. We responded by establishing an agile UX/UI room
cross and serving the teams involved in the evolution and maintenance of Jarvis.
The UX/UI room has expertise in Service Design, UX Design, UI Design, and Front-
end Development with the following responsibilities: evolution proposals,
requirements gathering, user testing, rapid prototyping, and updating and
improving front-end libraries.
