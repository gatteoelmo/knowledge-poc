"Fuori di Slack" newsletter

There are so many messages that are sent through Slack every day, and for
employees the risk is to miss key directions in the vast amount of content.

A weekly summary with key information posted on Slack to be conveyed through
newsletters.

Through the integration of generative AI models and the use of newsletters, the
project optimizes time and productivity and facilitates the use of information.

The “Fuori di Slack” newsletter was designed for Maize's internal communication
to provide a weekly summary with key information sent on Slack. 

Since there are many messages being sent, the risk is of missing key directions
in the large amount of content.

The system -based on generative AI models- collects key messages according to
human indications, extracts key information from them, and generates a summary
of each, plus a general one with an overview of all topics.

With the summaries the model also generates automatically images, which
accompany the text and make it more engaging and effective.The “Fuori di Slack”
newsletter has a significant impact on the effectiveness of internal
communication in Maize by improving information management in a message-rich
environment.

The project is a concrete example of how Artificial Intelligence can improve
business dynamics, contributing to clearer, more efficient and engaging internal
communication.
