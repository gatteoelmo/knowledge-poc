Communication to support the sales network in presenting the redesign of the HUB
Scuola platform

Following the redesign of the HUB Scuola educational platform, Mondadori
Education, Rizzoli Education, and Deascuola needed to develop informative and
training communication assets to support the promotion of the new version during
the sales campaign, positioning it as a reference tool for education. We
realized a campaign to support this crucial moment, providing the sales network
with the necessary materials to effectively promote HUB Scuola nationwide,
reassuring teachers about the changes introduced by the redesign and
accompanying them through the product's evolution.

Communication to support the sales network in presenting the redesign of the HUB
Scuola platform

Training the sales network of the three publishers to promote HUB Scuola
consistently across the national territory – a platform that supports teachers
and students in their daily learning activities.

A set of communication assets for educational and informative purposes was
developed to support the sales network in promoting the renewed platform during
the crucial campaign period.

Effectiveness of the sales network, strengthened positioning of HUB Scuola,
boosting adoption and addressing teachers' concerns regarding the redesign, with
reassurance and support in the transition.

During the sales campaign for the 2024/25 school year, Mondadori Education (ME),
Rizzoli Education (RE), and Deascuola (DEA) launched a new version of HUB
Scuola, aiming to position the platform as an authoritative reference in
education.

To effectively engage and train the sales network responsible for promoting the
platform throughout Italy during the campaign (before the start of the school
year), different assets were created:

Two videos: The first, aimed at the Sales Convention, focused on emotional
engagement, while the second, used in territorial presentations, concentrated on
practical information and more detailed content. Both videos use a smooth and
engaging motion graphic style, with vivid illustrations and seamless transitions
that convey the power of the platform in everyday education.

A PowerPoint template used both during the Convention and in territorial
meetings, ensuring visual and communicative consistency throughout the
promotional campaign. The template was designed to provide a clear and
recognizable identity for HUB Scuola.

To support the sales network, targeted training was organized, which included
reviewing PowerPoint presentations to ensure consistency with the campaign
style, and creating a visual package that enabled the autonomous production of
video tutorials on the platform's usage.
