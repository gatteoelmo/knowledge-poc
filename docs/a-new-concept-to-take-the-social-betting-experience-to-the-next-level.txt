A new concept to take the social betting experience to the next level

Our client, one of the leading international operators in the regulated gaming
sector, asked us to explore and test a new concept to advance social betting by
enriching the live betting experience.To define a new value proposition, we:

Structured a benchmark and highlighted the best-in-class for each transformation
driver compared to the initial panel of 33 players analyzed;

Conducted 12 1:1 interviews with end-users;

Designed 5 concepts accordingly and selected 2 with the client;

Delivered a survey to nearly 800 users on two concepts, produced a concept
prioritization report and defined the POC strategy.

A new concept to take the social betting experience to the next level

Explore and test a new concept to advance social betting by enriching the live
betting experience.

Benchmark to identify the best-in-class players; 

Qualitative research (panel of 12 users);

Design of 5 concepts and selection;

Survey (that reached nearly 800 users);

Definition of the POC strategy.

We defined 2 concepts to test through a survey that reached almost 800 users
(average rating: about 7 out of 10). We defined the POC strategy for the winning
concept to be accelerated.

After defining the opportunity area, i.e. a new value proposition related to the
world of live betting, we:

Structured a benchmark by identifying an analysis matrix of transformation
drivers. We highlighted the best-in-class for each transformation driver
compared to the initial panel of 33 players analyzed;

Conducted 12 1:1 interviews with end users and produced a summary report with
insights, quotes, and opportunities;

Made sense of the insights, designed five concepts, and defined with the client
two concepts to be further explored with users;

Delivered a survey to nearly 800 users to collect their points of view on the
two concepts. We focused on a significant sample to identify possible directions
useful for the detailed design and definition phase of the POC. 

Finally, we produced a concept prioritization report and defined the go-to-
market strategy, including POC objectives, key assumptions, and concept
features, with a focus on timing, mode of participation, moderation, content,
and format.
