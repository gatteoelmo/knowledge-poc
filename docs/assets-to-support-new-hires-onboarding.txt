ease of use for end users and the ability to adapt them to each country.

Creation of a guidebook and a checklist, both in digital format and customizable
for different countries, designed in line with the brand's visual identity.

The assets have organized and enriched the onboarding process, improving the
experience for new hires while ensuring consistency across countries, while
maintaining flexibility for local adaptations.

The project aimed to create custom graphic tools to support new hires during the
onboarding process, making the experience clearer and easier to navigate. The
guidebook, structured in 4 phases, contains all the essential information for
new joiners and has been designed to be easily consulted, with a format that can
be adapted to each country.

The checklist was created to ensure that every step of the process is followed
correctly. It features editable sections for personal data, while the rest of
the document is protected to maintain its integrity. Both tools are designed to
be easily distributed, both online and in printed format, and are user-friendly.

Additionally, a package of graphic assets was created in line with the brand's
visual identity, including color palette, typography, and a new naming+payoff to
ensure consistent communication across all channels.
