Satispay4Banks, an inspirational event to reward Satispay's sales network

Satispay is a new payment system that allows users to send money to friends and
pay in stores from their smartphones. The app is completely independent of
traditional payment circuits. 

To increase its market presence, Satispay signed partnerships with traditional
banks that became merchant resellers — one of the service's revenue makers. 

Satispay wanted to celebrate and reward its best reseller banks with
"Satispay4Banks," an event hosted and organized by us.

Satispay4Banks, an inspirational event to reward Satispay's sales network

Organize an event that mixed inspirational and team-building moments to increase
bank resellers' awareness of the Satispay brand.

A two-day event for Satispay, including logistics, organization, and content.

Finance industry insights, cohesion among participants (even among rival banks),
and happy moments.

The event was the result of a mix of ingredients: inspirational talks, team-
building, and fun moments for 60 people.

There were three inspirational talks: the first was from Alberto Dalmasso, who
spoke about the state of Satispay and its future. A second talk and panel with
Tamaz Georgadze, CEO and founder of Raizin, explored the future of finance. Alex
Bellini concluded with a motivational talk.

To inspire and engage the group, we organized a "team-building tour" dividing
participants into two groups of 30 people. The activities were "Empathy Toy" and
"Chain Reaction." Each activity lasted for an hour and a half and at the end of
each, the teams switched to other activities.

"Empathy Toy" is a blindfolded puzzle game that can only be solved when players
learn to understand each other and empathize with them. 

"Chain Reaction" teams competed against each other to design and assemble a
machine that performed a simple task in a complex way.

The event concluded with a relaxing trip to Venice.
