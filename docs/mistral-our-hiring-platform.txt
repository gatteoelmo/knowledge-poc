Mistral, our hiring platform

Mistral is a hiring platform designed for the Human Resources team.

The main section of the platform is the Call section, an overview to the open
positions where examiners and human resources evaluate candidates following pre-
established criteria called the Fields of evaluation. 

The platform is completed by two other sections: Candidates, to collect CVs and
evaluations, and Fields of evaluation where it is possible to customise, add and
modify the mentioned criteria.

Mistral, our hiring platform

To give the Human Resources team a solid evaluating methodology that simplifies
the hiring process and facilitates comparing elements.

A digital platform that combines an evaluation matrix with a 5 step path, in a
shared space with the whole recruitment team.

More than 450 registered candidates, 60 examiners and 45 open calls just in the
first year*

* referred to 2020

The hiring process starts with the opening of the call and includes 5 steps:

CV selection. This is the first phase which doesn't mean passing automatically
to the next one

Discovery meeting. This is the first interview and is conducted by HR to
investigate aspects like attitude or cultural fitting

Examination meetings. This type of interview is done by the examiners that
operate in the same area of the candidate. It could be repeated and with a
different examiner

Community experience. After the candidate passes the previous interviews it's
time for the in-house visit. The candidate is invited to have a chat with some
future potential colleagues of different levels and roles in order to confirm or
elaborate prior evaluations

Testing ground. In this last step the candidate needs to do a practical test to
validate the specific role skills and level

At the end of each step the candidate is evaluated with the Fields of evaluation
and the process ends with HR’s final appraisal.
