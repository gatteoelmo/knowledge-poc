Our framework to guide conscious conversations and generate sustainable ideas

The complexity of the world in which we operate is made up of ever-growing
challenges that are no longer just about understanding consumer needs, but also
about understanding technological impacts, climate phenomena, and social
conflicts. These challenges are not an 'outline' outside of companies, but have
a direct impact on their core business, what they are, what they do, and how
they do it. The goal of Burning Issues is to go beyond traditional innovation by
putting the entire ecosystem surrounding companies at the centre, guiding them
in imagining a conscious future, before it even happens.

Our framework to guide conscious conversations and generate sustainable ideas

Facilitating the process of generating ideas, evaluating and comparing them with
sustainability criteria.

A framework consisting of guiding questions and an assessment tool, which is
based on several thematic areas related to sustainability.

An evaluation system that adds a third axis to the two-dimensional impact-
feasibility matrix, the sustainability one (economic, environmental and social).

A methodology supported by an assessment tool based on 5 thematic areas related
to the world of sustainability:

People & communities impact

Trustful transparency

Change resilient knowledge

Phygital resources efficiency 

Circularity & waste reduction

Burning Issues is integrated into the innovation journeys we develop for our
clients to guide conscious strategic conversations and evaluate and compare new
ideas with the filter of sustainability. How?Questions: Envisioning and Idea
generationIn this first phase we use key questions to stimulate and activate an
informed dialogue supporting us in the conception and generation phase, allowing
us to address and shape the type of ideas that emerge. Tool: Idea refinement,
evaluation and prioritisation The tool comes into play when ideas take shape:

guiding us in defining the idea, confronting us with aspects not initially
considered

assessing its sustainability by giving each idea a score based on the
information we input

comparing ideas with each other, to help us choose those to improve and develop.
