Digital Creation, a program to empower the "creators" and connect them digitally

motto is "we make good tools happen for designers, so they can make good things
happen for consumers."

strategy, from concept to delivery, mainly focusing on 4 areas: training,

Digital Creation, a program to empower the "creators" and connect them digitally

Educate, inspire, and engage our client's designers, focusing on the importance
of adopting 3D tools in the creative and creation process.

A multichannel, all-encompassing, and ongoing mindset change and digital
development program.

Better understanding of the benefits generated by 3D tools, deeper knowledge of
the technologies available to designers, and improved relationships between
community members.

The program focused on three main areas: communication, training, and events.
All the areas were deeply intertwined, and they worked in parallel to build a
stronger community and deliver an organic message on multiple levels. 

Traditional communication consisted mainly of newsletters and special
communications, used to share news and the latest projects.

Training focused on improving designers’ 3D skills through a hands-on approach
and classes led by expert trainers.

Events had a broader scope: the idea was to use them to inspire and create a
sense of community among designers, thanks to the involvement of inspiring
guests and relevant personalities.﻿
