A REBRANDING PROJECT FOR A PUBLIC EXCELLENCE SCHOOL

A rebranding project for a public excellence school

We worked with a public institution of higher secondary education to redefine
its graphic identity, tone of voice, and key messages to help communicate its
values and attract new talent.

The rebranding process involved the school's teachers, engaging with them in a
workshop and a series of interviews.

The final product was a brand manual, including a logo, graphic identity and
tone of voice.

A rebranding project for a public excellence school

Create a new cohesive image and messaging for a higher education and research
facility that is part of the National System of Higher Education.

A journey to redefine the school’s graphic identity, tone of voice, and
messaging, including workshops and a collaboration with teachers.

Redefined logo, colors, iconography, typography, photography, presentation
video, tone of voice, and content for the School's website.

During the first phase of the project, we led a workshop for teachers to focus
on the school's identity, tone of voice, messaging to include and avoid, mood,
main themes to communicate, etc. The workshop was preceded by an exploratory
survey with the teachers, the results of which were aggregated and shared.

Once we reworked the workshop results, we aimed to redefine the school's graphic
identity and content one step at a time, involving teachers at every stage and
sharing documents and surveys with them for approval.

We designed a new logo; redefined colors, iconography and typography; studied a
new photographic style and collaborated on the creation of a launch video. At
the same time, we developed a series of documents to define the institution’s
tone of voice and a glossary of its most commonly used words, and rewrote
content on its website. We also studied the creation of a new stylistic approach
for digital and physical content, such as banners, social media, badges,
business cards, envelopes and letterhead. Everything was included in a Brand
Manual — the compass for the institution’s new identity.
