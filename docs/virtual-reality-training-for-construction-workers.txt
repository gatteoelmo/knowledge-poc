Virtual reality training for construction workers

Centro Edili di Venezia, in collaboration with SPISAL (Occupational Hygiene and
Safety Prevention Service) and Ulss 3 Veneziana (local health unit), operate in
the field of training and prevention of risks at work, for the construction
industry

We developed a simulator in virtual reality that allows promoting and improving
good working practices in construction companies, for a safer workplace.

Virtual reality training for construction workers

To create a tool that facilitates and encourages the improvement of best
practices at the workplace through the training delivered in the professional
training centers.

A VR simulator that gives the users the opportunity to check their skills and
knowledge on the field, in a totally safe virtual environment.

10 scenarios delivered with a proprietary platform that enables the trainers to
analyze and track the training process of each training center or user.

From an entire scenario or a single object, the first step of every digital
recreation is to gather all the possible photographic references. So it began
the entire process of virtualization of the training scenarios for construction
workers, from photos and videos taken in the real environments and actual
procedures done by an instructor on the field.

Once every material needed for the 3D recreation was gathered, the composition
of an entire virtual scenario, together with all the procedures, started.

After the programming of each interaction behind the simulation, the client had
the chance to test the scenario and to deliver it in a training center, as a
supportive tool for theoretical lessons.

Today the simulator has 10 procedures in it, from works that take place in high
heights, to the construction of a scaffolding structure.
