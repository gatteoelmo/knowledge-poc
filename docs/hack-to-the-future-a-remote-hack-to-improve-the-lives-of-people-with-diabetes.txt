Hack to the Future, a remote hack to improve the lives of people with diabetes

Novo Nordisk for the 100 years since the discovery of insulin wants to involve
its key stakeholders in the design of innovative solutions to improve the lives
of people with diabetes.

Hack to the Future is a remote hack in which diabetologists, psychologists,
pharmacists, nurses and representatives of patient associations collaborate to
design solutions facing the 3 proposed challenges. It is also a founding moment
to build lasting relationships with the participants, in order to create a
network of innovators who can work alongside Novo Nordisk in the development of
initiatives and projects about innovation.

Hack to the Future, a remote hack to improve the lives of people with diabetes

Celebrating 100 years since the discovery of insulin by engaging key
stakeholders around the disease of diabetes.

A 3 half-day remote hackathon to ideate innovative solutions for people with
Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes and diabetologists.

50 participants, 9 teams, 3 winners (1 per challenge) and a solution that Novo
Nordisk will develop in 2022.

To invite participants and communicate the event we created a website, a video
trailer and the voice of the experts, a series of audio pills with 4 selected
experts, to inspire and motivate participants before the hackathon.

About 50 specialists were invited and, divided into 9 groups, they addressed 3
challenges:

• Patient Empowerment

• Lifestyle and prevention

• Evolving role of the diabetologist.

The hackathon took place over 3 half days:

• Day 1: Inspirational speeches, launch and analysis of the challenges

• Day 2: Brainstorming, idea definition, pitch preparation 

• Day 3: Pitch of ideas, evaluations and celebration.

The jury selected one winning idea per challenge and, among these, the best
solution that will be developed by Novo Nordisk starting in 2022.

All participants will become part of Novo Nordisk's "digital board" to be
consulted and involved in other innovation-related initiatives.
