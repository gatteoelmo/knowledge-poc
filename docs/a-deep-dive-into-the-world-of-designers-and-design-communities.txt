A DEEP DIVE INTO THE WORLD OF DESIGNERS AND DESIGN COMMUNITIES

A deep dive into the world of designers and design communities

The client, a leading sportswear manufacturer, wanted to research and analyze
the best communities dedicated to design and designers, to understand the market
and identify potential collaboration opportunities. 

The research objective was to answer these questions: How can we succinctly
describe the complex scenario of design communities? Are there any main traits
that pull together these different social groups? Can we identify any common
patterns among the many different existing communities? What is the attitude of
the company's designers towards design communities?

A deep dive into the world of designers and design communities

Research the best design and designer communities online and offline, collecting
information and points of view about them.

Market research that considered affinities and potential opportunities among
communities and the fashion brand.

A document that categorized 49 communities and analyzed them for size, services,
segmentation, and more.

The project spanned from scouting the best communities to the identification of
the best trends and insights about them. 

The first need was to map the best design and designer communities to gain a
diverse cross-section and understand the market. 

Because there were a high number of communities, it was necessary to select the
best among them. We based our selection on potential affinities to the brand,
including affinities to the industry and product design, and opportunities for
collaboration.

Once the criteria was applied we explained the values and best community
initiatives. Finally, with in-depth observation of scouting results, it was
possible to identify insights about the overall design community environment and
its evolution.
