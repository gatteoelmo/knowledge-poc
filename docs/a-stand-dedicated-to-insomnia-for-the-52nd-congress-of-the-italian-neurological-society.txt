A stand dedicated to insomnia for the 52nd CONGRESS of the Italian Neurological
Society

We conceived and crafted an immersive exhibition stand for the debut of a
breakthrough chronic insomnia treatment at the 52nd SIN (Italian Neurology
Society) Congress. Our primary goal was to redefine insomnia as a 24-hour
condition, highlighting its profound impact on daily life. Amidst the congress
setting, our stand stood out, embodying the innovation of the molecule. Using
revolving mirrors and a simulated pathway, we aimed to forge a genuine
connection with attendees, showcasing the positive impact of the drug.

A stand dedicated to insomnia for the 52nd CONGRESS of the Italian Neurological
Society

To provide a distinctive experience communicating chronic insomnia as a 24-hour
affliction and showcasing drug innovation, fully compliant with the pertinent
AIFA guidelines.

An immersive and memorable stand, capable of standing out from its context,
establishing a real connection with the audience, and amplifying its messages
from scientific evidence.

We orchestrated the project from concept to site,  analyzing and developing the
narrative concept, along with curating the textual and graphic content for both
physical and digital assets.

To unveil a groundbreaking chronic insomnia treatment, our client entrusted us
with designing an exhibition stand for the 52nd SIN (Società Italiana
Neurologia) Congress. Our primary goal: introduce the new product to specialists
and redefine chronic insomnia as a 24-hour condition. Informed by scientific
studies, our team crafted an interactive installation, immersing attendees in a
metaphorical journey through a mirror-filled forest to illustrate the
disorienting impact of insomnia. The exhibition space featured rotating vertical
stems, enabling dynamic spatial configurations and engaging interactions. Each
stem, with a mirrored front, reflected various levels of distortion, depicting
patient experiences matched with scientific insights. As attendees approached
the main wall, a perfect mirror, accompanied by seats and an illustrative video,
served as a compelling focal point.
