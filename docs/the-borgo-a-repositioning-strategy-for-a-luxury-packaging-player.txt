The Borgo: a repositioning strategy for a luxury packaging player

Creating an ecosystem that combines sustainable innovation, education, and
heritage valorization to strengthen the brand’s positioning.

We supported the client in the strategic definition of The Borgo, a hub that
integrates innovation and craftsmanship in two key areas: sustainability and
heritage.

A clear roadmap aligned with business objectives to position the brand as a
leader in sustainable innovation in luxury packaging.

The The Borgo project was born from the client’s need to strengthen its
leadership in the luxury packaging sector through an initiative capable of
integrating sustainability, innovation, and the promotion of artisanal
expertise. To achieve this goal, we supported the client in defining the
positioning strategy through two key pillars:

Sustainable Innovation – A dedicated research and development area focused on
sustainability and material innovation:

The Innovation Atelier, a collaborative space for startups, universities, and
companies, fosters experimentation with biodegradable materials, second-life
packaging, and the reduction of the ecological footprint in production.

Give Back to the Territory – An initiative to revitalize local craftsmanship
through education and cultural appreciation:

The House of Traditions, which includes an Academy for training new talents and
an exhibition center showcasing the best of craftsmanship and brand heritage.

From a communication perspective, The Borgo represents a strategic opportunity
to build a distinctive brand identity and attract a diverse audience, from end
consumers to industry stakeholders.
