LEI: conducting a feasibility study of a chatbot for psychotherapy

The client’s goal was to create a voice assistant to help people with
psychological issues, accessible via mobile app.

We conducted a feasibility study through:

desk research of services already on the market

post deployment go-to-market analysis

architectural design

project plan with time and cost

We provided the customer with

A proof-of-concept chatbot

the comprehensive information needed to decide whether to continue with the
project.

The study focused on several use cases:

supporting the therapist in communicating with the patient and suggesting
competent specialists

support the patient with information to support and/or prepare for dialogue with
the specialist

support therapy with immersive virtual reality images during sessions.

We co-designed a profile for the assistant’s tone of voice. We analyzed some
similar services:

do-it-yourself exercise and meditation platforms

applications for addressing psychological problems

applications to support psychologists and hospitals

We also provided information regarding the potential market, in terms of:

digital trends and in particular conversational assistants in healthcare

statistics of patients, disorders and professionals

Therefore, we conducted a functional analysis aimed at supporting interactions
with text, voice, image and video mediums, and in virtual reality, with time and
cost estimates.
