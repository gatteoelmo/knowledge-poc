Define and develop a new platform, with the related business model, shifting the
value from the machineries to the service. A digital platform as an omnichannel
point of contact for the client.

A Venture Building project and a dedicated team to co-design the platform with
MAIZE, outside the corporate’s building and culture.

The team composed by 5 people was located in a dedicated office in the H-FARM
Campus and launched the platform in 2019.

ECHO is a platform that allows access to the shared economy concept and offers
customer a large amount of targeted information in real time: functions,
applications and solutions.

ECHO goes beyond the concept of "portal": it becomes an interchange ecosystem
between the corporate, the customers and the partners. In this way, the
ecosystem creates an omnichannel interaction as the only SIPA-Customer point of
contact where business operating processes become smart and available with one
click.

the project defining a manifesto to share with the candidates.
