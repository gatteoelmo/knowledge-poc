SAFETY AWARENESS CAMPAIGN

------------------------------------------------------------

Safety awareness campaign

We developed a campaign to raise awareness among the operators of an energy
company about workplace risks, integrating posters, videos, and in-person
discussion sessions. After analyzing incident and near-miss reports, we gathered
direct experiences from operators to identify the factors most frequently
leading to risky behaviors.

The key themes were transformed into targeted content, distributed across
different formats to combine information and active engagement. The campaign's
impact was measured through pre- and post-intervention surveys to assess changes
in risk perception.

Safety awareness campaign

Raise awareness among operators of an energy company about workplace risks in a
constantly evolving environment already rich in safety initiatives, ensuring an
effective and engaging message.

An integrated campaign with posters, videos and moments of dialogue, coordinated
to raise awareness about workplace risks. The impact was monitored through pre-
and post-intervention surveys.

Greater awareness of workplace risks, encouragement of dialogue among workers
and site supervisors, and strengthening of the safety culture, measured through
pre- and post-intervention surveys.

To increase awareness of workplace risks, a campaign was developed that combined
information and engagement. After analyzing incident data and gathering direct
experiences from operators, habitual behaviors with potential risks were
identified, and key themes were defined in collaboration with the safety core
team.

The iceberg concept guided the campaign, highlighting hidden yet hazardous daily
risks. Content was distributed through posters, videos, and discussion sessions,
creating an engaging and interactive journey. Posters not only captured
attention but also included QR codes linking to videos. These videos followed a
structured format: starting with a parallel situation from another profession to
illustrate a common mistake, then bringing the focus back to the operators'
context, and concluding with the correct behavior.

In-person discussion moments, known as Safety Breakfasts, were designed to
encourage dialogue between site managers and their teams. To make these sessions
even more engaging, an original element was introduced: custom fortune cookies
with safety-related messages, serving as conversation starters on key workplace
risks.

The campaign's effectiveness was assessed through pre- and post-intervention
surveys, measuring changes in risk perception and reinforcing safer workplace
behaviors.
