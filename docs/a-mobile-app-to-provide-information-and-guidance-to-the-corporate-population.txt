A mobile app to provide information and guidance to the corporate population

Generali Group has launched the “New Way of Working” program aimed at the
transformation of its global work environment. The Program has begun with an
Italian based flagship project (relocation of most of the existing Milan offices
to the new Generali Tower), that set the ground rules for the group wide change.

The Italian Flagship Project includes the adoption of new ways of working,
changing people’s behavior and creating a state-of-the-art work culture.

A mobile app to provide information and guidance to the corporate population

In the context of the movement of part of its population to a new location,
Generali is asking for support in the creation of a digital tool that
accompanies staff in discovering the new workplace.

Development and maintenance of a mobile application to provide information and
guidance to a specific portion of the Generali population which will move to the
new Generali Tower.

The app, created in a short time to meet the stringent timeline of a couple of
months, has made it possible to make many information materials available to a
potential >2000 users.

MAIZE designed and developed a multilanguage information app, available for iOS
& Android smartphones (Italian and English). We started from the development of
a graphic identity based on the General guidelines, which we applied to each
section (User interaction UX and User Interface). On a technical level, the
application is hybrid to enable functional evolutions and thus make offline
management of content possible. We have structured the content database on which
the CMS is built which enables the management by different types of users.
Security: SSO (single sign on) used only to secure application distribution.
