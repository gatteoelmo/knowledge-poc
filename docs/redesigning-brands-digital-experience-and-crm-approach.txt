Redesigning brand's digital experience and CRM approach

Realign the brand with the power of its name, through a new digital narrative
and a greater focus on the target audience and their needs.

Complete review of digital presence strategy (in a new omnichannel perspective)
and introduction of best-in-class platforms to support new guidelines.

Introduction of a new e-commerce platform capable of conveying the new brand
storytelling and a CRM platform to turn the new customer-centric strategies into
action.

We designed and implemented the new e-store based on the Salesforce Commerce
Cloud digital platform (Web and Mobile) combined with a new visual and graphic
identity.

We also led Trussardi in a new CRM approach aimed at leveraging customer data to
build personalized experiences thus creating new data-driven marketing
automation paths (e.g. abandoned carts, site section views, ...).

Activities also included:

SEO review to improve the organic positioning of the e-store (resulting in a 30%
increase in Y2Y SEO visibility on international SERPs).

Constant updates in the structure of the site and to integrate into the flow of
visitors the different landing pages developed for specific campaigns.

First activation of omnichannel delivery options (click and collect, pick and
pay, returns in store)
