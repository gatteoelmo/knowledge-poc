An immersive online experience for the launch of the Loro Piana Ryder Cup
collection

Loro Piana asked us to help them preview their new Ryder Cup collection to a
select few customers through an immersive digital experience.

An intuitive and engaging interface that allowed participants to discover the
details of the garments and appreciate Loro Piana's innovative technologies and
high quality materials.

The collaboration between our team and Loro Piana created an unforgettable
experience for the selected clients, who were fascinated by the collection and
its avant-garde presentation.

We worked with the Loro Piana team to create an immersive digital experience to
launch their Ryder Cup capsule collection.Aiming to create an immersive and
unique experience, we worked closely with the Loro Piana team to define the
objectives and requirements of the project. We created an intuitive design that
would highlight the products and provide smooth, user-friendly navigation. To
make the experience more immersive, we took advantage of 3D technology. The 3D
models allowed customers to explore the products from different angles, giving a
complete and detailed view of the materials, finishes and fabrics. Smooth
animations and transitions made the visual experience even more
immersive.Storytelling was another key aspect of the project. Through text, we
communicated the essence and value of the products, giving customers a
comprehensive overview of the distinctive features and innovative technologies
used.The end result is a website that combines 3D technology, animation and
storytelling to communicate the value of Loro Piana products in an effective and
engaging way.
