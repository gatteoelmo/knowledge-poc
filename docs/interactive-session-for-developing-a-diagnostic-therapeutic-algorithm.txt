Interactive session for developing a diagnostic-therapeutic algorithm.

The activity stood out for its dynamism and innovation. Supported by an
experienced tutor, approximately 80 participants worked on a real clinical case
to develop a decision-making pathway that reflected the daily challenges of
therapeutic practices.

The session generated great enthusiasm, transforming a standard training event
into a surprising and highly appreciated opportunity by the participants. The
recognition for the innovation of the activity was confirmed by both the client
and the sponsor, who were satisfied with the results achieved.

Interactive session for developing a diagnostic-therapeutic algorithm.

Deliver an interactive session within a training event to simulate a structured
decision-making process and guide participants in identifying the key steps.

The activity involved about 80 participants, divided into 4 groups, working on
creating therapeutic algorithms that were presented and evaluated by a
scientific board.

The client who organized the course and the sponsor appreciated the innovation
of the activity. Participants were enthusiastic about the session's dynamism and
satisfied with the results achieved.

The participants worked starting from a real clinical case and, supported by a
tutor, developed their own algorithm, focusing on the decision-making process in
a concrete therapeutic context. The session was divided into several phases: the
presentation of the clinical case by the tutor, the construction of the
algorithm to define the diagnostic-therapeutic pathway, and the deepening of
each step. The results were presented by the individual groups, and the one with
the highest score was chosen for the completeness of the steps and clarity of
the presentation.

The methodology adopted allowed each group to choose the workflow most aligned
with the clinical case and the participants' roles. Some groups preferred an in-
depth analysis of the case before structuring the pathway, while others followed
a progressive method, and some integrated analysis and construction
simultaneously.

The activity successfully engaged all participants, challenging their knowledge
and asking them to apply it in a practical and dynamic context, to experiment
with a new approach. The activity involved a large number of learners and saw
the active and dynamic participation of the scientific board, both in the design
and delivery phases. It was also an opportunity to exchange experiences, explore
strategies, and actively participate in a collective decision-making process.
