Performance simulators for life insurance products

Since 2015, we have been working with Generali Italia to help them design and
develop performance simulators for life insurance products. These tools are part
of the digital supports that Generali makes available to its sales network. The
aim is to facilitate the sales process in the preliminary stages and to
facilitate the identification of the most suitable investment that fit the needs
of the potential client.

Over the years, we have developed more than 10 performance simulators and many
of them are still in use.

Performance simulators for life insurance products

Support Generali in simulator engineering and development with tight timelines
(6-8 weeks).

Simulator development through an agile framework, so that each component can be
tested, fixed, certified and released quickly.

Since 2015, we have developed more than 10 simulators, many of which are still
in use and have a good adoption rate.

To facilitate the work of its sales network, Generali provides performance
simulators which are tools composed of a calculation engine and a connected
frontend.

Each simulator is connected to an SSO identification system that allows
recognizing the user (the agent) who is logging in and loading the history of
saved simulations.

The simulation happens through a series of steps in which the agent answers
together with the customer to some questions that allow returning a hypothesis
of the investment developed on 4 scenarios.

At the end of the simulation can be sent a recap to the customer via e-mail that
will be saved also in the history of the agent.

The simulators are instruments used in the preliminary phases of the sales
process, but still, they must respect the norms and be certified by the customer
before they can be made available. In this way, the client can be assured that
they will be able to take advantage of the benefits of the service.
