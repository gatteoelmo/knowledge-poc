A workshop to explore opportunities for generative AI

The client had the desire to experiment in generative AI, however, he had no
awareness of the potential of the technology and how it can be used in his
favor. From the collaboration between our AI team, who are expert in the
technology, and our Service team as a bridge between the two worlds, we defined
series of challenges and we created and delivered a one-day workshop to raise
awareness of the topic, explore possible applications, and define future
opportunities for the client.

of analyzing customer needs, a one-day workshop was designed at the H-Farm
campus in Roncade. Maize's experience helped the client gain awareness and
navigate the opportunities opened up by using generative AI technologies.The
workshop was designed in three parts:

Introduction to raise awareness and discover what generative AI is, why it is so
interesting, and what are the most exciting challenges;

Insight by studying use cases and application ideas; This part of the workshop
was concluded by conducting a survey and open discussion to investigate what
issues were most relevant to the client's interests;

Definition of opportunities by contextualizing on the client's needs the
applications discussed earlier; during this phase, processes to be intervened
on, projects to be activated and personalities to be involved were identified.
