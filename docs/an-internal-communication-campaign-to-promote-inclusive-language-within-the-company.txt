An internal communication campaign to promote inclusive language within the
company

After carrying out several internal initiatives dedicated to inclusive language
in recent years, which actively involved more than 300 people, the client — a
leading Italian telecommunications company — approached us with two needs:

Create a Human Language manifesto that encapsulates and represents the
perspective of the organization's people on DE&I.

Develop a creative concept for an effective communication campaign (supported by
impactful key visuals) to promote and convey the manifesto at all levels within
the company.

An internal communication campaign to promote inclusive language within the
company

A leading Italian telecommunications company asked for our support in writing
its Human Language manifesto and creating the creative concept for a campaign to
promote it within the company.

A manifesto composed of short, impactful phrases. 

Minimalist and accessible key visuals.

A content and visual guidelines document.

Greater awareness, at all levels of the organization, of the importance of
adopting Human Language. 

External communication (through social media and press) of the brand’s values.

After analyzing the documents provided by the client, we created the Human
Language manifesto, rich in concepts and nuances. Through short, impactful
phrases and a positive, non-judgmental tone of voice, it highlights the
beneficial effects of adopting inclusive language in the company. The first part
is poetic and inspirational, while the second, with more concrete examples,
shows how inclusive language is not made up of "only words" but also of daily
gestures and actions capable of transforming the reality we live in.

At the same time, we developed the communication campaign concept, built around
the idea that Human Language is the language of those who see the human being
first, before any difference. For the campaign’s key visuals, we used emoticons
(a clear reference to the old-school telecommunications world), composed of
punctuation marks, which are the very symbols of language. Paired with the
manifesto’s phrases, the emoticons represent positive, open attitudes,
emphasizing that inclusive communication also involves behaviors. Finally, we
drafted a document containing guidelines for inclusive writing, indications for
the campaign's tone of voice, and the rationales behind the visual concept.
