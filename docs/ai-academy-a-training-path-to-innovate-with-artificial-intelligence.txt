AI Academy: A Training Path to Innovate with Artificial Intelligence

Train the Sofidel team to understand and concretely apply AI technologies to
business contexts.

A three-phase program to spread knowledge, identify opportunities, and implement
concrete use cases with practical tools.

The project inspired an innovative mindset, identified strategic opportunity
areas, and trained the team on immediately applicable skills, with development
roadmaps ready for use.

Sofidel approached us to launch a training project that would help their
internal team understand AI technologies, separating myths from reality and
building practical skills for their use. The training program was structured in
three main phases:

Lift Up: Introductory and inspirational sessions to provide participants with an
overview of the state of the art in AI, along with interactive discussions and
insights gathering.

Use Case Definition: Workshops to identify AI application opportunities, analyze
pain points, and build prioritized use cases through design thinking
methodologies.

Deep Dive (optional): Vertical, targeted training to implement the defined use
cases, with practical sessions on specific technologies and project work to
create implementation roadmaps.

The approach integrated theoretical learning moments with hands-on exercises and
advanced technological tools, ensuring interactive engagement and a concrete
impact on the team. This initiative strengthened strategic and operational
skills, laying the foundation for the sustainable adoption of AI within business
processes.The approach integrated theoretical learning moments with practical
