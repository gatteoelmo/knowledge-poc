COMMUNICATION AND OPERATIONS FLOW MAPPING TO IMPROVE RETAIL EXPERIENCE

Communication and operations Flow Mapping to improve retail experience

One of the largest fashion retail companies worldwide, with over 500 shops,
needed to ground a transformation strategy with a view to improving the retail
experience. 

In the last years, the client has supported its retail network through multiple
digital communication and training touch-points, both in terms of tools
(software) and devices (hardware). This results in an overall fragmented
experience that seems not to suit store managers at best.

Communication and operations Flow Mapping to improve retail experience

Deepen the as is situation of fragmentation by mapping the experience of current
HQ and store people and bringing in-depth evidence to envision the future
strategy.

An as-is process analysis dedicated to HQ communication, operations and
information flow in order to understand the eventual mismatch with
communication, operation, and information flow about stores.

A map of tactical and strategic projects and initiatives that could possibly
solve and correct all the gaps highlighted during the analysis process on both
sides (HQ and stores).

The object of the project was to collect a double perspective (respectively from
HQ to retail and from retail to HQ) in order to:

Map all the processes with the involvement of the different stakeholders.

Highlight the specific pain points of each stakeholder/department.

We have been through different project phases in order to highlight these
elements such as:

Internal Qualitative session of 9 one-to-one interviews and one collaborative
session dedicated to the different HQ areas (IT, Training, Marketing, VM, L&P,
P&A, BI, Logistics).

External qualitative session of 14 one-to-one interviews with mixed figures from
stores in 3 different geographical areas (Italy, Germany, Poland).

Sense making and evidence matching.

Definition of tactical and strategical projects through a co-design session with
the stakeholders.
