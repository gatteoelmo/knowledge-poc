A PRIORITIZATION WORKSHOP OF AI-RELATED USE CASES

------------------------------------------------------------

A prioritization workshop of AI-related use cases

The client, through internal discussions, has identified AI application use
cases. These UCs are either dedicated to the distribution network or to internal
operations. The client asked for our help in prioritizing the UCs, based on
business value but also on technical feasibility, preferably using generative AI
tools.

A prioritization workshop of AI-related use cases

Prioritize a set of internally identified use cases (to be implemented with AI
tools) through a workshop

An in-person workshop in which we analyzed the UCs together in detail, providing
concrete examples of similar projects implemented by us

We produced a prioritization matrix, on which we arranged the UCs according to
business value and technical feasibility scores assigned to each

The customer identified 5 use cases dedicated to the distribution network and 5
on internal operations. For each of these UCs, they provided us with a brief,
high-level description. Our task was to detail the UCs, defining the most
appropriate technologies to implement them, the KPIs that would measure their
success, and any critical issues and requirements needed to implement the UCs.
We conducted an in-person workshop in which:

A contact person from the client company would briefly expound on the UC.

We would present our pre-analysis and present a case study already implemented
by us comparable to the need expressed by the client.

The client, with all this information, assigned a score of business value and
technical feasibility to the UC.

At the end of the day, the UCs were placed in a matrix in order to visualize the
most feasible ones.Subsequently, we were approached to realize with a project
the most valuable UC.
