A live-streaming annual kick-off experience

Stiga, a leading company in the field of motorized garden maintenance equipment,
asked for our support to organize its annual convention entirely remotely.

The need was to create an engaging moment for all European locations to present
the products and innovations that would launch the following year.

The final result of the project was a 6-hour live streaming event, with 19 live
and pre-recorded speeches, a presenter, and 14 connected countries.

A live-streaming annual kick-off experience

To create an innovative convention experience to involve all countries and
present new products and innovations.

A live-streamed event in which all Stiga business units, under the guidance of a
presenter, were able to talk about the new products and innovations launching
the following year.

High-level engagement for all of the countries' representatives, a high response
rate, and strong participation both before and during the meeting.

Stiga, a leading company in the field of motorized garden maintenance equipment,
asked for our support to organize its annual convention entirely remotely.

Their need was to create a highly engaging moment for all European branches to
present the products and innovations that would launch the following year.

After the set-up and kick-off phases, we moved on to video-record several
specialists' contributions at Stiga's headquarters. In the meantime, we
developed a virtual venue to host the streaming.

In the weeks preceding the event, we set up the room inside the Stiga HQ, and,
together with the client, we defined the lineup, the speeches to be broadcasted
during the live streaming, and the presentation structure.

A streaming set was organized on the day of the event at Stiga’s HQ. The live
streaming set included a lighting system, audio equipment, two cameras, and a
technical setup for encoding, streaming, live broadcasting, and live,
simultaneous translation.

Visitors were able to participate in the event by accessing a dedicated site,
which also hosted a chat where users could interact directly with the studio
through surveys and Q&A moments.
