these tools into their daily activities. The program covered advanced topics,
starting with a general overview of artificial intelligence, followed by the
exploration of concrete use cases in digital marketing. Participants had the
opportunity to explore how AI can be used to generate content, optimize
marketing campaigns, and improve lead generation and recruitment activities.A
central element of the program was "prompt engineering," a specific section
dedicated to teaching participants how to interact effectively with AI tools.
Through practical activities, participants learned how to build effective
prompts aimed at addressing situations similar to the "pain points" expressed by
the team, enhancing the effectiveness of their interactions with AI
technologies. The sessions were enriched with hands-on experiments in teams,
allowing participants to apply the skills they acquired in use cases relevant to
them.
