A DIGITAL REPOSITIONING PROCESS

A digital repositioning process

Dmail, a historic mail-order brand, has been through a period of re-launch on
all retail channels (physical stores, postal catalogs, telephone, digital). 

The brand asked us for support in the digital repositioning process. We
redefined the digital visual identity, rethinking the e-commerce platform, to
better support a strategy inspired by the logic of content-to-commerce and
multichannel.
