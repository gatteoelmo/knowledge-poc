Digital Accessibility Training Rooms for Tuscany Region

Prepare and run digitally accessible classrooms in a very short timeframe,
ensuring sessions were engaging and effective.

We quickly created the materials and defined the exercises to be done in groups,
maintaining a dynamic and engaging teaching approach.

Despite the difficulties, the project was successfully completed, receiving
appreciation for the quality of the training and the flexible approach.

We were contacted by the Client to organize digital accessibility classrooms for
the employees of the Tuscany Region, with a start scheduled for two weeks later.
The project proved to be particularly challenging due to the limited resources
and short time frame.Not only did we have to prepare a large number of sessions,
but we were also informed that the participants would not have PCs available to
complete the exercises, which would have to be done on paper.Despite this, with
excellent teamwork and working closely with the Client, we quickly adapted the
materials already at our disposal and prepared the team for the start of the
project. In a short time we were able to complete the classroom sessions
successfully, obtaining excellent feedback from the participants who appreciated
the dynamic approach and interactive management of the classroom.
