Offsite rete - workshop empathy toy

Generali requested support for a team-building activity for their sales support
team, focusing on collaboration, empathy, and mutual understanding among the
team members.

We proposed Empathy Toy sessions, where participants were divided into small
teams with specific roles to work on communication, collaboration, empathy.
Sessions included debriefings and rule changes.

The activity was very well received, with the client highly satisfied and
motivated. They expressed interest in repeating the activity with other teams to
improve daily collaboration and teamwork.

Generali asked for support in organizing a 4-hour team-building activity for
their 15-person sales support team. The main themes were collaboration, mutual
understanding, and empathy. We proposed a sequence of Empathy Toy sessions, with
participants divided into teams of 4-5, each with a specific role: a builder, a
guide, and an observer. After each session, debriefings were held to discuss
what worked and what didn’t, with rule changes to observe how dynamics evolved.
At the end, a retrospective helped reflect on how group dynamics could improve
daily teamwork. The client was very satisfied and motivated, intending to repeat
the activity with other GEN teams.
