Forma: an Academy to enhance know-how and strengthen positioning

Our client embarked on a strategic journey to consolidate its role in the luxury
packaging and visual merchandising sector, focusing on training and knowledge
sharing. The project led to the creation of Forma, a structured academy to
enhance internal expertise, increase brand awareness, and attract new talent.
Through interviews, industry benchmarking, co-design workshops, and a targeted
communication plan, we defined the academy’s identity, training roadmap, and
visual assets to ensure coherence and effectiveness.

Forma: an Academy to enhance know-how and strengthen positioning

Creating an academy to enhance corporate know-how, strengthen brand positioning,
and attract new talent.

Development of an Academy Roadmap consisting of key training and positioning
initiatives, represented by a strong brand identity and supported by a dedicated
communication plan.

Positioning the company as a leader in sustainable luxury packaging and creating
a recognizable and attractive internal and external training ecosystem.

In 2024, our client initiated a transformation process to reinforce its
positioning in the luxury sustainable packaging sector. The main challenge was
to create a structured system to leverage corporate know-how and make it
accessible both internally and externally, positioning the company as a
reference point in the industry.

To meet this need, we developed the Forma, an academy that integrates training,
communication, and brand identity. The project was structured into several
phases:

Analysis and Insight Collection: Conducted interviews with the client's core
team and carried out industry benchmarking to identify ongoing activities to
build upon.

Co-Design Workshops: A collaborative process involving key stakeholders to
define the Academy’s structure, formats, and priorities.

Defining the Academy Identity: Development of a distinctive narrative, a clear
Tone of Voice (TOV), and coherent visual assets (logo, color palette, editorial
guidelines).

Development of the Training Roadmap: Creating a strategic plan with content,
formats, and digital touchpoints for content delivery.

Communication Plan and Launch Video: Production of editorial materials and a
video to position and promote the Academy both internally and externally.
