Camera Café, a digital coffee break to connect with our colleagues

Camera Café is a digital format created during the Covid-19 that virtually
replicates the coffee break between colleagues in the office.

These informal meetings aim to socially reconnect employees, forced to work at
home by the pandemic, and make them feel part of a group.

Camera Café, a digital coffee break to connect with our colleagues

Restore the social interactions between colleagues, that were typical of the
office routine and have been lost as a result of Covid-19, in order to make
employees feel less alone.

Two 20-minute digital coffee breaks per week throughout the duration of the
lock-down (March - May 2020).

All colleagues can participate to the event on a voluntary basis.

More than 20 digital coffee breaks organized among colleagues between March and
May 2020.

Camera Café is a digital format organized by our team in order to contrast the
severe social isolation imposed by Covid-19.

The initiative virtually replicates the coffee break in the office among
colleagues, thus offering employees an opportunity to discuss and update each
other on non-work topics despite the physical distance imposed by smart working.

In concrete terms, Camera Café consists of 2 weekly meetings, of a short
duration of 20 minutes in the post-lunch time slot.

Participation is on a voluntary basis and employees can easily access to the
meeting by connecting to virtual rooms created ad hoc for the event.
