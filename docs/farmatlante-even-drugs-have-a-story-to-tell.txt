Farmatlante: even drugs have a story to tell

Our client, a global pharmaceutical company, deals with the treatment of
diabetes and other serious chronic diseases such as obesity, blood diseases, and
rare endocrine diseases.

The client asked us to design a remote workshop experience in order to map the
different identities of their drugs, define their "drug archetype", the tone of
voice, and key messages.

Farmatlante: even drugs have a story to tell

Today, the drug is a pass, a promise, an invitation and a story. Telling it in
the right way to all stakeholders is a major challenge, especially given the
limitations of industry regulation.

"Farmatlante", a three-part experience to map out the narrative of any drug, its
own identity,  purpose and future - in a word -  its own story.

We successfully mapped the identity of two drugs by identifying their archetype,
key messages, tone of voice and building a proper marketing brief.

A three-part workshop exploring three main islands: Purpose, Imaginary & Actors,
and Communication Strategy.

Each of these islands represents a series of collaborative exercises during
which, by means of maieutics, the participants are involved in defining the
identity of the drug in question, the main actors and the imaginary of
reference, ending with a purely strategic part that aims to identify the tone of
voice and the reference archetype.

For the occasion, we've reinterpreted the traditional brand archetype wheel by
mixing theories coming form different authors and our own experience in the
field of branding in such a complex industry such as the Pharma one.

A highly collaborative experience to bring out the deep identity of the drug on
focus and understand which of the selected archetypes reflects it, so as to find
the right tone of voice with which to communicate to its target audience the
themes and messages that are most relevant to them.
