Quaranteen, our experiment to face quarantine

An internal initiative to keep the dialogue, team spirit, and sense of belonging
alive during the lockdown.

Daily and diverse challenges, shared on Slack channel and to be completed within
the end day.

At the end of the initiative (approximately 25 days) we analyzed data and
derived useful insights on mood, workflows and engagement, creativity and
inclinations.

The initiative consists in the launch of a daily challenge on the dedicated
Slack channel, starting in the morning and must be completed by the same
evening.

The rules we've established for creating the challenges are few and simple:

feasible with items we already have or can easily obtain

representative of who we are, ranging from the most creative to the more
rigorous tasks(*)

achievable within a maximum of 30 minutes

(*) This reflects the diverse identity of the Maize team. Consequently, the
challenges are all different in terms of approach and theme: fresh, multi-
channel and somewhat challenging.
