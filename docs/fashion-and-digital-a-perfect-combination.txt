Fashion and Digital, a perfect combination

Finding contact point between two worlds at a first glance very different but
extremely similar indeed, Craftmanship and Digital. Prove the effectiveness of
3D Workflows within craftmanship processes.

We digitized the entire "Sensitive Capsule" for the launch of their new
e-commerce supported by multiple digital content.

Using digital tools made fine tuning and iteration much faster and proficient.
Outputs such as AR and Photo Integration have also made possible product
analysis in new and unexplored contexts.

Starting from three-dimensional models of their products, realised through the
use of software dedicated to the fashion industry, we applied our knowledge to
optimize and extend the use of the single Asset so that it could be used in
multiple forms and contexts.

From a single Asset, we have created multiple outputs designed for different
phases and contexts such as:

High quality renderings (e-commerce)

Photographic integration of the digital product

Draping simulations and animations

Augmented reality product visualizer to appreciate volumes, materials and color.
