Design and writing of the corporate website redesign tender brief

The client, an Italian luxury brand well known for its jewelry, watches,
fragrances, accessories, and leather goods, needed support in writing the tender
brief with the aim of redesigning the Corporate website. We led a phase of
context and need analysis which allowed us to gather relevant information and
insights necessary for the drafting of the brief.

Design and writing of the corporate website redesign tender brief

Writing the tender brief for the corporate website redesign, summarizing the
needs of markets and business units and integrating them with relevant trends of
the luxury market.

A brief document containing an overview of the brand, context information, key
drivers on the future role of the .com and details on the deliverables required
to respond to the tender.

A precise and exhaustive guide, high enough to not limit the creativity of the
respondents to the tender.

The first phase of the project focused on analyzing and understanding the
existing context: 

the corporate site in all its components

materials, key documents and guidelines 

We then focused on identifying the vision about the future role of the .com
conducting around thirty remote qualitative interviews with the management team,
markets and business units. We then mapped the big amount of information
collected in order to identify recurring patterns, pain points, areas of
attention, relevant insights and specific needs. This important analysis and
mapping work has allowed us to define the heart of the document, 13 key drivers
clustered in 4 categories: 

Brand Storytelling 

User experience 

Market & Business Unit customization 

Content organization 

In addition to this section, we have structured an introduction useful for
summarizing the key elements of the brand, a part of guidelines on the design
operational framework and technical landscape, and a final section with details
on expected times and deliverables.
