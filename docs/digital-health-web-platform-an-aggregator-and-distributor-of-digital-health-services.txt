Digital Health Web Platform, an aggregator and distributor of Digital Health
Services

The client, a well-known insurance company, asked us to design an aggregator and
distributor of Digital Health Services.

The project was developed through a design process that integrated the
methodologies of Service Design and Co-design, with the aim of defining a strong
concept and a differentiating value proposition; creating the User Experience
and the User Interface that best met the needs that emerged from the initial
analysis; facilitating the relationship between all the stakeholders (suppliers
of the individual services).

Designing an aggregator and distributor of Digital Health services that can act
as a single point of entry and connect different touchpoints.

A multi-device application that is accessible and usable in a customised manner
depending on the profiling in which the user is placed and an application
console for user management.

A landing page presenting the service, a profiling questionnaire for the user, a
customised dashboard, a back-office management console.

In order to realise an aggregator and distributor of Digital Health services, we
carried out a design process divided into the following phases:

analysis)

a co-design workshop for the definition of the customer journey and
prioritization of the project intervention points

sprints with Agile methodology

design of the single functionalities through wireframes and definition of the
visual style guide
