Takeda Bootcamp, an omnichannel training experience

In recent years, companies operating in the Pharma sector have experienced
challenging changes, first of all the rapid digital acceleration.

If, on the one hand, also because of the pandemic, it was necessary to adopt a
multi-channel way of working, on the other hand people within companies did not
always find themselves having all the tools to behave at their best.

We supported Takeda in transferring a new omnichannel strategy to the entire
company population, in particular to three groups of people (marketing, medical
and sales).

Takeda Bootcamp, an omnichannel training experience

Design an engaging and distinctive learning experience on the topic of
omnichannel, which integrates in-person and online moments.

A training course co-designed with the Takeda core team composed of different
levels (webinars, e-learning courses, inspirational speeches and 3 in-person
bootcamps).

3 workshops to design the experience, 3 bootcamps on the H-FARM Campus with 250
people involved. An online course and several inspirational interventions.

After receiving the new OCE strategy from the headquarter, Takeda Italia needed
to design a learning experience to transfer the new skills to the entire company
population.

There were several project objectives: promoting the understanding and
implementation of the new omnichannel strategy, strengthening internal
alignment, countering silo-oriented work and spreading a new, innovative and
proactive mindset.

We thus designed a path that include:

1. an initial moment of context analysis and deep understanding of the new
omnichannel strategy.

2. an assessment to verify the population's starting point on digital and
marketing issues.

3. an e-learning to lay the theoretical foundations necessary to understand the
new OCE strategy

4. three co-design workshops with the Takeda Italia core team, to define the
activities and objectives of the training events

5. three in-person events to ground what has been learned with exercises in a
workshop dynamic.
