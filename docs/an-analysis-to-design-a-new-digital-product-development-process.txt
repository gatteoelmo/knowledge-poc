An analysis to design a new digital product development process

Loro Piana, the world's leading artisan company in luxury goods, belonging to
the LVMH group, asked us to experiment and subsequently implement 3D technology
applied to apparel development. 

The goal is to make the traditional process more efficient through digitization,
with the aim of making the current way of working more agile and streamlined.

An analysis to design a new digital product development process

Experiment with 3D technology, analyze the current workflow process and build a
new digital process.

A process of analyzing the workflow by investigating opportunities and critical
issues, designing a new digital process, and experimenting with the digitization
of different products.

A strategic plan to implement digital and 3D in a long-term path.

The analysis and design course of the new process had a dual objective. Firstly,
to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current workflow process in order
to design a digital mode of operation. Secondly, to create internal awareness of
the potential of 3D technology.

For the first objective, a field analysis was conducted through various
interviews to map out the traditional workflow process, taking into account
current opportunities and challenges, and envisioning the use of 3D in the
future.

Simultaneously, a training course was delivered to impart knowledge on 3D
technology to management and the product team, who were also provided with the
opportunity to learn the basics of using certain software.

The combination of the analysis of the current process and the training
activities fostered cross-stakeholder collaboration in the company, resulting in
the design of a new high-level digital process. This process served as the
foundation for developing a strategic plan for future implementation, which was
preceded by a feasibility study.
