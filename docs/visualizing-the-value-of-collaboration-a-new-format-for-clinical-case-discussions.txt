Visualizing the Value of Collaboration: a new format for clinical case
discussions

With the goal of introducing a new mode of interaction within a “traditional”
event, the project focused on two key moments

Group discussion: aiming to enable table moderators to systematically and
structurally collect the information and insights shared by clinicians;

Preparation and feedback of the discussion: selecting the most interesting
insights and leveraging the power of data visualization to share them
effectively with the audience.

Visualizing the Value of Collaboration: a new format for clinical case
discussions

To design an innovative format for a training event focused on clinical case
discussions to support 85 clinicians in the field of oncology view the value of
collaboration under a new light.

An Excel data collection file that serves as a database for creating data
visualization dashboards through a semi-automated Figma file used for presenting
the results.

The format sparked curiosity among participants not only during the event but
also afterward, leading the board to propose presenting the findings in a
scientific publication.

With the aim to emphasize the value of the interactions and the factors at play
— such as roles and timing — that led to those decisions, the project, carefully
designed in close collaboration with the scientific board, unfolded in 5 stages:

Designing the data collection file and pre-event questionnaire: We began with a
brainstorming session alongside the board to identify the key information to
track, based on an analysis of clinical cases and the critical decision points
expected to shape the discussion. We also pinpointed relevant demographic data
to be gathered through a survey of all participants.

Visual model proposals and Figma design: We explored various ways to visualize
the data and developed a Figma file to enable semi-automated data entry during
the event.

Data collection: Throughout the discussions, moderators at each table were
supported in filling out an Excel file to record information in real time.

Initial analysis and deck creation: Early visualizations were shared and
patterns were identified regarding interaction styles, specialties most likely
to lead the discussion, and timing. These insights were compiled into a
presentation deck.

Pre-feedback alignment with the board: The storytelling was refined with the
scientific board, and key insights were articulated clearly alongside the data
visualizations to prepare for the final report.
