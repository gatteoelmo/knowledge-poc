Hic Sunt Dracones, an atlas of the organization

Following a corporate identity redesign, we needed to find a way to spread
mindset and principles throughout the organization. 

For this reason we designed an atlas that tells our story, our principles and
the way we work, in order to create a unique identity among people in the
organization and orient newcomers.

Hic Sunt Dracones, an atlas of the organization

After an internal reorganization, it was necessary to spread the new identity,
create cohesion between groups of people from different units and allow them to
get to know each other.

An atlas that tells the story of the organization's milestones with the goal of
creating a unique, shared identity and being able to spread it among all people.

A book that tells about our evolution, philosophy and team, a set of descriptive
cards of the main projects, an infographic poster that summarizes some key
concepts.

When we became HIC (Human Innovation Culture) in 2019, after a unit merger, we
felt the need to put our story down on paper, to land on a common vision of who
we are and what we do.

That's why we created an atlas that would contain all the information needed to
orient new entries and help the rest of the organization to get to know each
other better and understand the cornerstones of the new identity.

The book consists of three parts:

Get Started: collects manifesto, principles, offering 

Explore: a guide to onboarding with a series of tests and activities (having
coffee with colleagues, opening a budget on the management system, etc.)

Curtain: a collection of portraits of HIChers and a glossary of phrases and
sayings typical of the organization

Accompanying the book, a set of cards describing the main projects and a summary
infographic.

The choice to create a physical support was deliberately made to embellish the
object and make the codification of identity special. The idea was in fact to
have an object to take care of, to keep or give as a gift to let people know who
we are.
