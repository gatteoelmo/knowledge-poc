MYCAMPUS, A DIGITAL CATALOG OF EMPLOYEE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES

MyCampus, a digital catalog of employee training opportunities

In 2016, an Italian leader in the Finance & Banking industry asked us to
design a digital collection of employee training opportunities.

A few years after its first release, the client asked for our help to redesign
the platform experience and user interface, to make it compliant with current
brand guidelines while increasing user engagement.

To achieve these goals, we surveyed stakeholders' needs and used these insights
to redefine the platform's value proposition and redesign the experience.

MyCampus, a digital catalog of employee training opportunities

Find a user-centered, easy-to-use solution to increase accesses to the platform.

A one-day workshop with 30+ people, that was used to define the platform's value
proposition and redesign. As well as one user test session spanning a varying
company demographic.

A new platform with a simplified structure and useful search functionality.

The project started by analyzing the user's point of view (the client provided
us with insights from more than 1,000 surveys and two focus groups), which we
considered to design the workshop.

Starting from these insights we defined four project drivers:

A simplified structure (e.g. fewer menu items)

A filtered catalogue based on user preferences (user profiling filter options)

A review of content priorities (with mandatory training highlighted)

A closer connection to the training environment

Following these directions, we built an MVP to be tested with seven different
users. Most of them were satisfied with the new platform, which allowed us to
implement upgrades and finalize the project.
