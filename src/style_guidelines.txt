# General structure

1. Structure

Each case presentation follows a clear three-part structure:

Opening / Context (what the project is about, who the client is, what challenge was addressed).
Objectives / Approach (what was the goal, how it was tackled, key steps or methodology).
Results / Impact (what was delivered, outcomes, measurable impact, future use).

This tripartite structure is consistent across all cases, even if not explicitly labeled.

2. Flow of the Narration

The narration typically flows like this:

Title: Always a descriptive, narrative title — written almost like a newspaper headline.
Client / Sector framing: Short introduction naming the client (if possible) and situating the challenge in its industry context.
Objective(s): High-level articulation of what the project set out to achieve.
Approach / Process: Explanation of the methodology, broken into steps, phases, or design choices.

Challenge / Need: Brief explanation of the client’s initial problem or question.
Solution / Deliverables: The tangible things created (tools, dashboards, events, platforms, etc.).
Impact / Outcomes: Concrete results (numbers, adoption, business change, feedback).

# Guideline for Opening Paragraphs

The opening paragraph introduces the reader to the project at a glance. It establishes context and relevance before diving into objectives and methods.

It must be 60 to 80 words long

Characteristics:

- Concise: 4–6 sentences maximum.
- Neutral tone: Informative, not promotional.
- Narrative: Written in plain prose (not bullet points).
- Client-centered: Mentions the client or organization (if shareable) and situates them in their industry.
- Challenge or Opportunity: Highlights the problem, question, or ambition the client brought forward.
- Why now?: Often hints at the broader context (market shifts, internal needs, innovation goals).

The storytelling always moves from problem → goal → process → result.

# Structure of the Main Content

The main content must be nop longer than 180-200 words, it serves as the “core narrative” section of the case history.
The goal is to explain concretely what was done for the client, showing both how the project was carried out and what impact it produced. The structure is outlined below.

## Initial Conditions / Setup

What had to be in place before the real work could start. Example: “After hardware and logistical requirements were established…” / “From the collaboration of our AI technology experts…” / “Sofidel approached us to launch a training project…”

## Process / Approach

Step-by-step description of what was done. Sometimes written as a chronological narrative (first → next → finally). Sometimes organized as phases/modules with names or bullet points. Example: design & storyboard → build 3D environments → client validation OR Lift Up → Use Case Definition → Deep Dive.

## Collaboration / Interaction

Highlighting the interplay between experts and the client. Example: “Close collaboration and validation from the client…” / “open discussion to investigate what issues were most relevant…”

## Outcomes / Results

What the client gained or what was enabled. Example: “instant way of accessing a complete catalog of training experiences” / “gain awareness and navigate opportunities” / “strengthened strategic and operational skills.”

# Executive summary

This is built in 3 brief sections, each of about 20 words

- Challenge: Brief explanation of the client’s initial problem or question.
- Solution: The tangible things created (tools, dashboards, events, platforms, etc.).
- Impact: Concrete results (numbers, adoption, business change, feedback).
